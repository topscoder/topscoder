### Hi there 👋

Developing in whatever language fits the most. Not speaking all of them though. Mostly Python, PHP, Node.js, C++. I often get a lot of inspiration by the tools, gear and other assets that are used by fellow developers. One of which is probably the most famous: https://wesbos.com/uses. At least it was my first inspiration for creating this profile here on GitHub.

Gear I have around:

- 🤖 Macbook
- 🤖 Logitech MX Master
- 🤖 Mac keyboard (I'm looking for a mechanical alternative)
- 🤖 Sony WH-XM3
- 🤖 Google Coral TPU
- 🤖 Arduino's, Raspberry Pi's
- 🤖 Philips Hue Bars w/ Circadian Lighting

Apps I'm using:

- ⚡ Amphetamine – to keep my Mac awake when I want to.
- ⚡ Authy – my favourite OTP tool to use for 2FA codes. 👉 It syncs between devices!
- ⚡ Bitwarden – open source password manager. Used 1Password as paying customer until they switched to monthly payments.
- ⚡ Discord – connecting to other people a.k.a. IRC 2021
- ⚡ Docker – all things virtual.
- ⚡ Filezilla - open source FTP, FTPS, SFTP client.
- ⚡ Kitty Terminal – Cross Platform high performance Terminal using GPU power.
- ⚡ Rocket – Easy emoji usage.
- ⚡ [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) – The missing window manager in macOS.
- ⚡ Sublime Text – Fast editor I use a lot to open / edit files when I need speed.
- ⚡ Visual Studio Code – Highly customisable editor. Started very basic, but starts to act like a IDE if you want to.

Other facts:

- 🔭 I’m syncing most of my application settings across different devices using [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
- 🔭 [Starship](https://starship.rs/) shell prompt
- 🔭 [FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com)
- 🔭 I'm switching often between several Color Schemes in editors. Early Adopter of Solarized Dark but [Noctis](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis) I like probably the most at the time.
- 🔭 I try to give back to the dev-community by contributing to Open Source software whenever I see Issues, Typos, Documentation issues etcetera. Started by fixing small typos and creating Pull Requests. You should do too!
