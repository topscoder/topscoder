### Hi there 👋

Developing in whatever language fits the most. Not speaking all of them though. Mostly Python, PHP, Node.js, C++. I often get a lot of inspiration by the tools, gear and other assets that are used by fellow developers. One of which is probably the most famous: https://wesbos.com/uses. At least it was my first inspiration for creating this profile here on GitHub.

Apps I'm Using:

- ⚡ Amphetamine
- ⚡ Authy
- ⚡ Bitwarden
- ⚡ Discord
- ⚡ Docker
- ⚡ Filezilla
- ⚡ Kitty Terminal
- ⚡ Rocket
- ⚡ [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)
- ⚡ Sublime Text
- ⚡ Visual Studio Code

Other facts:

- 🔭 I’m syncing most of my application settings using [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
- 🔭 [Starship](https://starship.rs/) shell prompt
- 🔭 [FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com)
- 🔭 I'm switching often between several Color Schemes in editors, but [Noctis](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis) I like probably the most.
- 🔭 I try to give back to the dev-community by contributing to Open Source software whenever I see Issues, Typos, Documentation issues etcetera. Started by fixing small typos and creating Pull Requests. You should do too!

Inspiration sources I use:
