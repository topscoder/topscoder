### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Developing in whatever language fits the most. Not speaking all of them though. Mostly Python, PHP, Node.js. I often get a lot of inspiration by the tools, gear and other assets that are used by fellow developers. One of which is probably the most famous: https://wesbos.com/uses. At least it was my first inspiration for creating this profile here on GitHub.

Apps I'm Using:

- âš¡ Amphetamine
- âš¡ Authy
- âš¡ Bitwarden
- âš¡ Discord
- âš¡ Docker
- âš¡ Filezilla
- âš¡ Kitty Terminal
- âš¡ Rocket
- âš¡ [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)
- âš¡ Sublime Text
- âš¡ Visual Studio Code

Other facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m syncing most of my application settings using [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
- ðŸ”­ [Starship](https://starship.rs/) shell prompt
- ðŸ”­ [FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com)
- I'm switching often between several Color Schemes in editors, but [Noctis](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis) I like probably the most.

Inspiration sources I use:

- ðŸŒŸ https://uses.tech
- ðŸŒŸ https://gitmoji.dev
- ðŸŒŸ https://github.com/dannyfritz/commit-message-emoji

I'm interested in:
- Web Application development
- Mobile Application development
