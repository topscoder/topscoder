### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<!--
Semi easter egg ðŸ‘€
https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme
-->

Developing in whatever language fits the most. Not speaking all of them though. Mostly Python, PHP, Node.js, C++. I often get a lot of inspiration by the tools, gear and other assets that are used by fellow developers. One of which is probably the most famous: https://wesbos.com/uses. At least it was my first inspiration for creating this profile here on GitHub.

Gear I have around:

- ðŸ¤– [Apple Macbook](https://amzn.to/2TZfxGt)
- ðŸ¤– [Logitech MX Master](https://amzn.to/3rUZpSU)
- ðŸ¤– [Mac keyboard](https://amzn.to/3ClWdEG) (I'm looking for a [mechanical alternative](https://amzn.to/2VtoRTH))
- ðŸ¤– [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://amzn.to/3lDCWbW)
- ðŸ¤– [Google Coral TPU](https://coral.ai/products/)
- ðŸ¤– [Arduino's, Raspberry Pi's](https://amzn.to/3lAMvs7)
- ðŸ¤– [Philips Hue Bars](https://amzn.to/2Vso5Go) w/ [Circadian Lighting](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting)

Apps I'm using:

- âš¡ [keepingyouawake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake) â€“ to keep my Mac awake when I want to.
- âš¡ I switched from Authy to [Raivo OTP](https://github.com/raivo-otp/).
- âš¡ [Bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden) â€“ open source password manager. Used 1Password as a paying customer until they switched to monthly payments.
  - ðŸ‘‰  I'm still looking for a neat and safe alternative for Bitwarden. The UI and UX of Bitwarden is far behind 1Password.
- âš¡ Discord â€“ connecting to other people a.k.a. IRC 2021
- âš¡ Docker â€“ all things virtual.
- âš¡ Filezilla - open source FTP, FTPS, SFTP client.
- âš¡ Kitty Terminal â€“ Cross Platform high performance Terminal using GPU power.
- âš¡ Rocket â€“ Easy emoji usage.
- âš¡ [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) â€“ The missing window manager in macOS.
- âš¡ Sublime Text â€“ Fast editor I use a lot to open / edit files when I need speed.
- âš¡ [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) â€“ Highly customisable editor. Started very basic, but starts to act like a IDE if you want to. VSCodium is the privacy friendly port of VSCode.

Other facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m syncing most of my application settings across different devices using [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
- ðŸ”­ [Starship](https://starship.rs/) shell prompt
- ðŸ”­ [FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com)
- ðŸ”­ I'm switching often between several Color Schemes in editors. Early Adopter of Solarized Dark but [Noctis](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis) I like probably the most at the time.
- ðŸ”­ I try to give back to the dev-community by contributing to Open Source software whenever I see Issues, Typos, Documentation issues etcetera. Started by fixing small typos and creating Pull Requests. You should do too!

- ðŸŒŸ https://gitmoji.dev

All In One Installation (aka .dotfiles)
---

Every few months I [cleanup my computer(s)](https://www.imore.com/how-do-clean-install-macos) by formatting the entire machine and start with a [fresh OS installation](https://www.imore.com/how-do-clean-install-macos). In order to install all my fellow apps and tools in a fast and convenient way, I've created a setup tool with .dotfiles. Look around and you'll find some inspiration. Promised!

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topscoder/topscoder/main/installer.sh)"
```
