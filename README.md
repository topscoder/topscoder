### Hi there 👋
<!--
Semi easter egg 👀
https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme
-->

Developing in whatever language fits the most. Not speaking all of them though. Mostly Python, PHP, Node.js, C++. I often get a lot of inspiration by the tools, gear and other assets that are used by fellow developers. One of which is probably the most famous: https://wesbos.com/uses. At least it was my first inspiration for creating this profile here on GitHub.

Gear I have around:

- 🤖 [Apple Macbook](https://amzn.to/2TZfxGt)
- 🤖 [Logitech MX Master](https://amzn.to/3rUZpSU)
- 🤖 [Mac keyboard](https://amzn.to/3ClWdEG) (I'm looking for a [mechanical alternative](https://amzn.to/2VtoRTH))
- 🤖 [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://amzn.to/3lDCWbW)
- 🤖 [Google Coral TPU](https://coral.ai/products/)
- 🤖 [Arduino's, Raspberry Pi's](https://amzn.to/3lAMvs7)
- 🤖 [Philips Hue Play](https://amzn.to/2Vso5Go) w/ [Circadian Lighting](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting)

Apps I'm using:

- ⚡ [keepingyouawake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake) – to keep my Mac awake when I want to.
- ⚡ [Bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden) – open source password manager. Used 1Password as a paying customer until they switched to monthly payments.
- ⚡ Discord – connecting to other people a.k.a. IRC 2021
- ⚡ Docker – all things virtual.
- ⚡ Filezilla - open source FTP, FTPS, SFTP client.
- ⚡ [Fig](https://fig.io) – Forget every terminal app. Fig is your terminal, reimagined
- ⚡ [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) – Easy emoji usage.
- ⚡ [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) – The missing window manager in macOS.
- ⚡ [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) – Fast editor I use a lot to open / edit files when I need speed.
- ⚡ [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) – Highly customisable editor. Started very basic, but starts to act like an IDE if you want to. VSCodium is the privacy friendly port of Visual Studio Code.

Other facts:

- 🔭 I’m syncing most of my application settings across different devices using [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
- 🔭 [Starship](https://starship.rs/) shell prompt

- 🔭 I try to give back to the dev-community by contributing to Open Source software whenever I see Issues, Typos, Documentation issues etcetera. Started by fixing small typos and creating Pull Requests. You should do too!

All In One Installation (aka .dotfiles)
---

Every few months I [cleanup my computer(s)](https://www.imore.com/how-do-clean-install-macos) by formatting the entire machine and start with a [fresh OS installation](https://www.imore.com/how-do-clean-install-macos). In order to install all my fellow apps and tools in a fast and convenient way, I've created a setup tool with some `.dotfiles`. Look around and you'll find some inspiration. Promised!

https://github.com/topscoder/topscoder/blob/main/installer.sh

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topscoder/topscoder/main/installer.sh)"
```
