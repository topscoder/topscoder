### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Developing in whatever language fits the most. Not speaking all of them though. Mostly Python, PHP, Node.js, C++. I often get a lot of inspiration by the tools, gear and other assets that are used by fellow developers. One of which is probably the most famous: https://wesbos.com/uses. At least it was my first inspiration for creating this profile here on GitHub.

Gear I have around:

- ðŸ¤– Macbook
- ðŸ¤– Logitech MX Master
- ðŸ¤– Mac keyboard (I'm looking for a mechanical alternative)
- ðŸ¤– Sony WH-XM3
- ðŸ¤– Google Coral TPU
- ðŸ¤– Arduino's, Raspberry Pi's
- ðŸ¤– Philips Hue Bars w/ Circadian Lighting

Apps I'm using:

- âš¡ Amphetamine â€“ to keep my Mac awake when I want to.
- âš¡ Authy â€“ my favourite OTP tool to use for 2FA codes. ðŸ‘‰ It syncs between devices!
- âš¡ Bitwarden â€“ open source password manager. Used 1Password as paying customer until they switched to monthly payments.
- âš¡ Discord â€“ connecting to other people a.k.a. IRC 2021
- âš¡ Docker â€“ all things virtual.
- âš¡ Filezilla - open source FTP, FTPS, SFTP client.
- âš¡ Kitty Terminal â€“ Cross Platform high performance Terminal using GPU power.
- âš¡ Rocket â€“ Easy emoji usage.
- âš¡ [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) â€“ The missing window manager in macOS.
- âš¡ Sublime Text â€“ Fast editor I use a lot to open / edit files when I need speed.
- âš¡ Visual Studio Code â€“ Highly customisable editor. Started very basic, but starts to act like a IDE if you want to.

Other facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m syncing most of my application settings across different devices using [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
- ðŸ”­ [Starship](https://starship.rs/) shell prompt
- ðŸ”­ [FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com)
- ðŸ”­ I'm switching often between several Color Schemes in editors. Early Adopter of Solarized Dark but [Noctis](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis) I like probably the most at the time.
- ðŸ”­ I try to give back to the dev-community by contributing to Open Source software whenever I see Issues, Typos, Documentation issues etcetera. Started by fixing small typos and creating Pull Requests. You should do too!
